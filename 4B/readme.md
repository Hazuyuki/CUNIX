The program uses BFS to search the strategy.

The state in BFS is presented by (a, b, c) which means we have aml water in the 8ml cup, bml water in the 5ml cup and cml water in the 3ml cup.

The program tells that we can do the job in at least 8 steps, and the following shows the strategy:

    8 0 0

    3 5 0

    3 2 3

    6 2 0

    6 0 2

    1 5 2

    1 4 3

    4 4 0
