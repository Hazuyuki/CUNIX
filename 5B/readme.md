This program realizes the encoding and decoding process btween csv format and a binary file format (.bin). The encoding process simply reads every single bytes in the csv file, and write them to a binary file, besides, it changes every ',' to ASCII 1 to make it different from the csv file.


Simply make and run the program, then it will generate output.bin and output.csv from input.csv, which represent the encoded binary file and the csv file decoded from the binary file.
